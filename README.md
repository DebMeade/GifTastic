# GifTastic
This is a page where users can click on the buttons associated to different celebrities and see 10 gif associated to each celebrity.  The user is also able to add new celebrities to the list if they want to see gifs for a different celebrity.  When the page loads each giphy is a still image.  If the user would like to see the animated version they can click on the image and it will change to the animated version.  If they would like to see the still image again that can be acheived by clicking on the picture again.

The giphy's are pulled from giphy.com using an API key acquired from giphy.com.  The still images and animated images were selected by referencing their location in JavaScript and then referencing a click function.   The page was built using HTML, CSS, SavaScript and jQuery.

The game can be accessed by vising the following URL:
